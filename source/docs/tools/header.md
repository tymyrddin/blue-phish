# Email header analysis 

Copy and paste the entire email header and run the analysis tool.

* [Messageheader](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/analyzeheader)
* [Message Header Analyzer](https://mha.azurewebsites.net/)
* [mailheader.org](https://mailheader.org/)

It is good to have multiple resources to refer to as each tool might reveal information that another tool may not reveal.

## Sender's IP address

* [IPinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/)
* [URLScan.io](https://urlscan.io/)  provides a screenshot of the URL. This screenshot is provided, so you don't have to navigate to the URL in question explicitly.
