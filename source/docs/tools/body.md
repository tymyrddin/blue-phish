# Email body analysis

The email body is where a malicious payload may be delivered to the recipient either as a link or an attachment.

* [URL Extractor](https://www.convertcsv.com/url-extractor.htm)
* [CyberChef Extract URLs recipe](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

Note the root domain for the extracted URLs and do an analysis on the root domain as well. Also check the reputation 
of the URLs and root domain.

If the email has an attachment

* Obtain the attachment safely. Accomplishing this is easy in Thunderbird by using the `Save` button.
* Get its hash and check the file's reputation with the hash to see if it's a known malicious document.
