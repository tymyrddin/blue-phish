# Spyware

Spyware infects a device via the installation of [a malicious app that has disguised itself as harmless](squatting.md). This means you could unknowingly infect your device with malware by downloading a malicious file from the web. Spyware can be spread to a device via [pishing](../independent/phishing.md), smishing, and vishing.

Spyware is designed to track activity on whatever device, or devices, it is installed on: websites visited, contacts, applications used, and login details for various online accounts, meaning payment details, social media logins, sensitive files, and other confidential data become vulnerable.

## Detection

* Spyware uses the device resources, making the battery drain unusually fast.
* Spyware causes an increase in CPU usage. This causes the CPU to overload and overheat.
* Unusual changes and charges.
* Suspicious credit card activities.
* Increased data usage.
* Because spyware runs in the background continuously, it interferes with the shutdown process, making it slower. 
* Spyware can record calls. While recording, it can create weird background noises like taps, static noises, distant voices, echoes, or random sounds. These noises can be heard on mobile phone calls or during video conferences.

## Mitigation

* Manual removal does not require any tool or technical knowledge.
* Factory reset.
* Using Spyware Removal Software.

## Prevention

* Have antivirus software installed on all devices. Many antivirus subscriptions offer multi-device cover, so check to see if your existing plan offers this, or whether you can find a provider that does. 
* Keep device operating systems as up to date as possible. Having the most recent upgrade can improve security levels. 
* Always use strong passwords on your social media accounts, user profiles, and apps. Use a different password for each account.
