# Ransomware

Any ransomware tool development must be lucrative for the threat actor, which used to be far less likely in the case of locking a mobile device, as compared with locking all the Windows systems in an organisation. The bring-your-own-device (BYOD) trend has been growing for many years though.

With Android the most common operating system for mobile devices, ransomwares targeting Android are on the rise. Publicly known ransomware threats to iOS are substantially less prevalent.

Mobile ransomware sneaks onto your device using social engineering tactics that trick you into downloading malicious content, such as fake apps from third party app stores, [app squatting](squatting.md), infected system or software updates, [phishing](../general/phishing), or [smishing](smishing.md).

Traditional ransomware encrypts the files on a device, and some, but not all, Android ransomware variants do encrypt. WannaLocker uses AES encryption to encrypt files.

Different types of living of the land techniques" techniques can be used to deny a victim access to the device:

* Abusing functionalities (MalLocker).
* Hijacking permissions (Strandhogg attack). 
* Resetting device PIN (DoubleLocker and CovidLock).

Both [iPhone](https://ios.tymyrddin.dev/docs/malware/ransomware) and [Android](https://android.tymyrddin.dev/docs/malware/ransomware) users have easy access to cheap, cloud-based backup tools (Apple iCloud and Google One), which makes it easy to wipe and restore devices, in the event of a ransomware attack, with minimal loss of data.
