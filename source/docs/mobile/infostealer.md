# Infostealer

For a reasonable monthly fee, adversaries who do not know how to write their own InfoStealer can simply pay to use one written by an expert. It works the same way as popular subscription services. Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)! We only had to wait for it. Anyone with a few hundred bucks worth of bitcoin can get started with a few clicks. 

Once a threat actor has purchased an InfoStealer from a dark web or Telegram marketplace, their next task is to spread the malware onto as many machines as possible: 

* Embedding the InfoStealer into a document (e.g. a Microsoft Word document or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) then sending the doc out as an attachment in cleverly worded [phishing emails](../general/phishing.md), [smishing](smishing.md) or [vishing](vishing.md), that entice people to open the file. 
* Creating a convincing site with a lookalike domain, the logo of a trusted brand, and a convincing design that tricks unsuspecting users into voluntarily downloading the InfoStealer, thinking that it is a legitimate app. 
* Adding the malicious code to a [squatted app](squatting.md), and then making that corrupted lookalike application available for download from popular app stores. 
* Paying for advertising on Google Ads and Facebook Ads to trick more people into downloading the malware. Using paid ads to distribute malware works wonders because it leverages the trust that people have in both the advertising platform and the brand that they are impersonating on the fake site. If a user sees an ad after making a query in a search engine, they implicitly assume that it is safe to click because they trust the search engine.

The increased sophistication and complexity is making it more difficult for defenders to detect and prevent infostealers, and requires way more robust operation security training.
