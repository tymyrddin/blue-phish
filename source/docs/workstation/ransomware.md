# Ransomware

## Windows

* CryptoLocker was one of the first major ransomware attacks, encrypting files and demanding a ransom to release them.
* WannaCry affected hundreds of thousands of devices across 150 countries.
* NotPetya was a devastating cyberweapon that caused widespread destruction, especially in Ukraine.
* Bad Rabbit spread through a drive-by download. 
* GandCrab targeted more than a million users.
* Ryuk targeted large organisations in the healthcare industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Sodinokibi/REvil, the successor to GandCrab, caused havoc in various sectors.
* ...
* CloAk emerged between late 2022 and the beginning of 2023. In August 2023 the group published the data of 25 victims, mostly from Europe and with a special focus on Germany.
* Metaencryptor is a new ransomware gang that published the data of 12 victims in August 2023.
* RansomedVC published the data of nine victims on its leak site in August 2023. The group has adopted the ideology of other ransomware actors: "We are doing it for pentesting", and humorously adds that any vulnerabilities found must also be reported to Europeâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), threatening victims with data breach fines if the ransom is not paid.

## *nix

Linux is on the list of the most used operating systems, for workstations, servers, mobiles (android is linux based), and IoT devices. Linux powers the Internet with 74.2% of all web servers running on it. Hence, a profitable target. 

* RansomEXX (or Defrat777) is one of the most common recent ransomware attacks against Linux. It was used against high-end targets in 2020 and 2021. It does not use C&C communication and targets was hard-coded.
* Tycoon is one of the most common Linux ransomwares. In late 2019 it was used in attacks against education organisations and companies in the software industry. Its payload is in a ZIP archive with a malicious Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component, hidden in a Java image file. Both Linux and Windows are vulnerable to Tycoon attacks.
* Erebus was originally Windows-based, and repurposed to target Linux servers. 
* QNAPCrypt focuses on infecting network-attached storage (NAS) Linux devices. 
* KillDisk also started on Windows and was later adapted for Linux environments.

## macOS

* LockBit operators created encryptors to target Mac devices for the first time. Supposedly the first-ever ransomware campaign focusing on macOS in particular.
* ThiefQuest (also known as EvilQuest) became a threat in June 2020, having been discovered by researcher Dinesh Devadoss. The program was found hiding in pirated versions of the Little Snitch app, which could be found on a Russian torrent platform.

No device can ever be called completely secure. All devices, including Apple products, still run the risk of being infected.
