# Ransomware

* LockBit operators created encryptors to target Mac devices for the first time. Supposedly the first-ever ransomware campaign focusing on macOS in particular.
* ThiefQuest (also known as EvilQuest) became a threat in June 2020, having been discovered by researcher Dinesh Devadoss. The program was found hiding in pirated versions of the Little Snitch app, which could be found on a Russian torrent platform.

No device can ever be called completely secure. All devices still run the risk of being infected.
