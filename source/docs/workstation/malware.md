# Malware trends

There is a plethora of malware for Windows. Linux, Unix and other Unix-like computer operating systems are generally regarded as very well-protected against, but not immune to, computer viruses.

Some can infect Linux and Windows systems. StripedFly for example, is capable of a lot more than just mining cryptocurrency: it can execute commands remotely, grab screenshots and execute shellcodes, steal passwords and other sensitive data, record sounds using the integrated microphone, move to adjacent endpoints using previously stolen credentials, abuse the EternalBlue exploit to worm into other systems, and lastly - mine Monero. Monero mining is now seen as a distraction, to prevent researchers from analysing the code further. This malware has infected over 1 million Windows and Linux computers around the globe since 2016, [according to Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/stripedfly-perennially-flying-under-the-radar/110903/).
