# Malware

Some malware can infect Linux ***and*** Windows systems. 

StripedFly for example, is capable of a lot more than just mining cryptocurrency: it can execute commands remotely, grab screenshots and execute shellcodes, steal passwords and other sensitive data, record sounds using the integrated microphone, move to near endpoints using previously stolen credentials, abuse the EternalBlue exploit to worm into other systems, and mine Monero. Monero mining is now seen as a distraction, to prevent researchers from analysing the code further. This malware has infected over 1 million Windows and Linux computers around the globe since 2016, [according to Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/stripedfly-perennially-flying-under-the-radar/110903/).
