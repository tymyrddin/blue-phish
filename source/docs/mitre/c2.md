# Application Layer Protocol: Mail Protocols

[MITRE ATT&CK T1071.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/003/) reads _Adversaries may communicate using 
application layer protocols associated with electronic mail delivery to avoid detection/network filtering by 
blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will 
be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server._

SMTP and C&C communication: [APT 28](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007), [APT 32](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050), and 
[Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010), to name a few, have used this technique.

## Detection

_Analyze packet contents to detect application layer protocols that do not follow the expected protocol standards regarding syntax, structure, or any other variable adversaries could leverage to conceal data._

## Mitigation

_Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level._
