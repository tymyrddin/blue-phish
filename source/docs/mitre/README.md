# Introduction

## What?

Understanding our current defensive capabilities and mapping them against Mitre Att&Ck framework. MITRE offers a better understanding of the operations of threat actors, enabling systematic and repeatable categorisation.

## Why?

Helpful for discovering where and how best to invest our time and energy. Then layer the same with potential threats to our devices and (home) networks. The gaps discovered are the areas that should be focused first.
