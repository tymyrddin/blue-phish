# Introduction

## What?

Investigating known related MITRE tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed by adversaries. 

## Why?

MITRE offers a better understanding of the operations of threat actors, enabling systematic and repeatable categorisation.

As part of their efforts to support the Att&Ck framework, Mitre tracks 138 cyberthreat groups. Monitoring the collective activity of these groups is an essential component of mapping and analysing the threat landscape.
