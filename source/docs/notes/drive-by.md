# Drive-by download

A drive-by download attack refers to the unintentional download of malicious code to your mobile device that leaves you open to an attack. This can happen while browsing a legitimate website or through a malicious advertisement displayed on an otherwise safe site. This type of attack comes in authorised and unauthorised varieties. In the latter case, it is not necessary to click on anything, press download, or open a malicious email attachment to become infected.

Drive-by downloads can install non-malicious potentially unwanted programs or applications (PUPs/PUAs, which are clean, but may be [madware](madware.md) at its worst) or malware-loaded attacks with intention to hijack the device, install spyware, or to ruin data or disable the device (making it personal).

## Authorised downloads

1. Adversary creates an online message, ad, or a legitimate program download.
2. You click the link, download the software, etc.
3. You do not opt out of extra software, or aare sent to a malware-infested site.
4. Adversary and malware take control of your data.

## Unauthorised downloads

1. Adversary compromises a legit web page using a security flaw in website and adds a malicious component.
2. You visit the page, and it finds your device's security flaw.
3. The flaw is exploited and malware is downloaded to your mobile device.
4. The adversary has control over your device.

## Prevention

* Use your admin account for app installations. Admin privileges are necessary for drive by downloads to install without your consent. Use a second non-admin account for daily use.
* Keep browser and operating system up to date. New patches help seal gaps in defenses. Install immediately when released.
* The more code on the device, the more susceptible it is to infections. Prune often. Only keep what you trust and use often.
* Use an internet security software solution on all devices. 
* Avoid websites that may contain malicious code. Sites that offer file-sharing or mature content are common points of infection. 
* Carefully read and examine security popups on the web before clicking. Scammers use deceptive popup ads on desktop and mobile browsers that look like legitimate alerts. Watch for typos, odd grammar, and grainy images.
* Use an ad-blocker. Drive-by download attacks often use online ads to upload infections. Using an ad blocker can help reduce your exposure to this type of attack.
