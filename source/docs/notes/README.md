# Introduction

## What?

Mobile malware is a generic term for malicious software designed to target mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, and iOT devices) with the goal of gaining access to private data.

Apparently it is still not as pervasive as malware that attacks traditional workstations, and that may have to do with the fact that SOC teams and SIEM stacks have focused mostly on detecting workstation and corporate network threats, and that it was only a matter of time before hackers switched tactics.

## Why?

It is definitely a recognised/growing threat and needs to be addressed.
