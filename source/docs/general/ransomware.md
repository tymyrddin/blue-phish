# Ransomware

Ransomwares are not new, but are becoming more-sophisticated and complex. These target mostly businesses because there is more profit to be had. Ransomware can infiltrate networks with the help of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operations. Distribution apparently has become more concentrated as adversaries carry out more targeted attacks using quickly adaptable and sophisticated playbooks.

With so many devices out there, it seems like mobile would be an excellent target, but not much attention is given to [mobile ransomware](../mobile/ransomware.md). Yet.

The attention goes to [ransomware attacks on worktations](../workstation/ransomware.md).
