# Threat trends

In general, attackers are multiplying, diversifying their exploits, and making attacks more targeted. Cybercrime organisations and nation-state offensive groups operate much like traditional companies, with responsibilities, deliverables, and objectives for employees. They quickly adopt new technologies, and have deep pockets from past exploits or nation-state sponsors, allowing experimenting with and incorporate new technologies, like generative AI, that make their attacks more complex and harder to detect.

Most modern malware families use botnets for command and control (C2) communications. With the growth in malware families and variants, it is to be expected that botnet activity increases as well.

There is a [rise in ransomware frequency and complexity](ransomware.md), increased botnet activity, and a shift in [Mitre Att&Ck](../mitre/README.md) techniques used by attackers.
