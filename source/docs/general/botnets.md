# Botnets

A botnet is a collection of devices connected via the internet, each running a single bot or series of bots. Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS), crypto mining and click fraud are common activities done by botnets to enable adversaries to access a device. Attackers use Command and Control (C&C) software to control devices.

The number of "active days" (time between when botnet activity was first detected by sensors and when the botnet stopped communicating) increased, while the time between running C&C's has decreased thanks to [using attack infrastructure as code (IAC)](https://iac.tymyrddin.dev/).
