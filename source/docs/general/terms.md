## Malware

***Viruses*** are able to self-replicate and spread throughout the system of a device.

***Worms*** replicate from computer to computer, without infecting other objects on the same computer. They can spread across networks by exploiting device vulnerabilities. Worms damage your device by using up bandwidth and delivering payloads of harmful code.

***Adware*** displays unwanted advertisements and pop-ups on your screen, and can even track your online behaviour and display personalised ads. Adware was initially created for PCs, and is now a veritable explosion on mobile devices ([madware](../mobile/madware.md)). It can be bundled with spyware.

***Spyware*** is a catch-all term for programs as diverse as adware, riskware and Trojans when they monitor your online activity, observe what keys you press, and harvest your personal data.

***Bots*** are created to automatically perform specific operations. Some bots, like search engine crawlers, are considered to have been created for legitimate purposes.  Other bots scrape and harvest data for adversaries to exploit it.

***Ransomware*** blocks access to a device or holds files on the device to ransom to demand payment from users in return for regaining control of their device.

***Rootkits*** steal identity information and gain control of a system. It is a type of virus that can give administrator level access to a device. They evade detection. Detecting and removing a rootkit is a complex process and typically requires the use of specialized tools.

***Trojan horses*** also steal information. They typically mask themselves as ordinary files, and are usually less harmful than rootkits. Often they are easily detected by antivirus software. Trojans can carry out a range of functions:

* Trojan droppers contain code with the ability to secretly install malicious programs onto your computer.
* Trojan downloaders download and install new versions of malicious programs onto your computer.
* Trojan spies track activity on the device and send information to the adversary.
* Banking trojans disguise themselves as genuine apps and steal banking information.
* Backdoor trojans find their way onto your computer by exploiting vulnerabilities without your knowledge. These are staged attacks. First using social engineering like [phishing](phishing.md) to install a dropper, which then uses a vulnerability to install a backdoor trojan (which can be a rootkit).
